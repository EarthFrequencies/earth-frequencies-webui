   <tr id="C48"><td>C48</td><td class="detail">(CAN-04) The use of the band 29.1-29.25 GHz by the fixed-satellite service (Earth-to-space) is limited to feeder links for the mobile-satellite service.</td></tr>
   <tr id="C49"><td>C49</td><td class="detail">In the bands 7 250-7 750 MHz and 7 900-8 400 MHz and, in all or a portion of, the bands 20.2-21.2 GHz, 30-31 GHz and 39.5-40.5 GHz as required, the use of the fixed-satellite service is limited to the Government of Canada.</td></tr>
   <tr id="C50"><td>C50</td><td class="detail">In the bands 7 250-7 375 MHz, 7 975-8 025 MHz, and 43.5-45.5 GHz and, in all or a portion of, the bands 20.2 -21.2 GHz, 30-31 GHz and 39.5-40.5 GHz as required, the use of the mobile-satellite service is limited to the Government of Canada.</td></tr>
   <tr id="C51"><td>C51</td><td class="detail">(CAN-14) The band 38.6-40 GHz is being licensed for applications in the fixed service, which will be given priority over fixed-satellite service systems sharing this spectrum on a co-primary basis. Fixed-satellite service implementation in this spectrum will be limited to applications which will pose minimal constraints upon the deployment of fixed service systems, such as a small number of large antennas for feeder links.</td></tr>
   <tr id="C52"><td>C52</td><td class="detail">(CAN-00) Use of the band 47.2-48.2 GHz by High Altitude Platform Systems (HAPS) will be governed by spectrum utilization policies which will be formulated in the future.</td></tr>
   <tr id="C53"><td>C53</td><td class="detail">(CAN-14) In the bands 161.9625-161.9875 MHz and 162.0125-162.0375 MHz, a moratorium is placed on the authorization of new stations in the land mobile and fixed services. Existing stations, not used for automatic identification systems (AIS) purposes, will be displaced according to a future transition policy to enable full implementation of AIS.</td></tr>
   <tr id="C54"><td>C54</td><td class="detail">(CAN-14) The band 2750-2850 MHz is used for the operation of the 10.7 cm solar radio flux monitoring programme at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO) located near Penticton, British Columbia. Other users of the band are urged to give all practicable protection to this passive operation.</td></tr>
