The harmonised military bands are: -30.30-30.50 MHz; 32.15-32.45 MHz; 41.00-47.00 MHz; 73.30-74.10 MHz; 79.0-79.70 MHz. When providing for additional requirements, further blocks of frequencies should be spread out over the whole common military tuning range in order to supply frequencies for frequency hopping equipment and to support a larger force (corps size, three divisions). This should be done by the national frequency management organisation(s) concerned.   </td></tr>
