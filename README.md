Earth Frequencies Viewer
========================

This project provides tools for viewing radio frequency allocation data and 
other various information regarding the radio spectrum.

The data used by this projected is taken from http://github.com/ajmas/EarthFrequencies

Given that the data is provided by volunteers who have done their best to convert the
data from official sources, into computer parseable form, there may be errors in the
data. For this reason use this as a guide or starting point, but follow the official
documentation for your region, for anything that may have legal or commercial
implications.
